	<p><tr><th><p>Rambutan is a fruit from the Malay-Indonesian area. It is not very popularized within the United States because of how hard it is to eat. To eat thi fruit, you need to break the outside shell with your teeth, without stabbing yourself with the little spikes that line the outside.The fruit is somewhat like a grape, but it has a tiny seed within the middle with the fruit attached around the seed. You need to peel the fruit off of the seed without eating it, because the seed is technically poisonous. The fruit is very sweet and tastes like a juicier grape.</p></th></tr></p>
